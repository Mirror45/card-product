# 🛒 Card Product

**Card Product** is a single-page application (SPA) for an online store where users can browse, view, and purchase products. The project demonstrates a full shopping flow with a product catalog, detailed product pages, an image gallery, and a modal-based checkout form.

## 🗂️ About the Project

The application includes:

- 📦 **Product Catalog** — a list of available items with selection options  
- 🧾 **Product Page** — image gallery (Swiper), description, reviews (accordion), and quantity selector  
- 🛍️ **Checkout Modal** — a form popup triggered by the "Buy" button  
- ⚙️ **SPA Architecture** — built with React Router for smooth navigation  

Key challenges solved during development:

- Building UI components with **JSX**  
- Styling via **Styled Components** (CSS-in-JS)  
- Creating interactive components like gallery, modal, and accordion  
- Setting up **client-side routing** with React Router DOM  
- Customizing CRA with **react-app-rewired**  

> ⚠️ Responsive layout is **not implemented** — the project is optimized for desktop only.
